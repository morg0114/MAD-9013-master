Domain:
    www.example.com
        ".com" is called top-level-domain or TLD or domain extension
        "example" is called second-level-domain or SLD
        "www" is called subdomain
        
Sub domain:
    www
    A subdomain is an easy way to create a memorable Web address 
    for unique content areas of your site. 
    For example, you could create a subdomain for pictures on your site called "pics" 
    that is accessible through the URL pics.example.com in addition to www.example.com/pics.
